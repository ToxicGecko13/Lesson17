Assignment: 
*   Create a new repo called lesson17
    There is starter code at https://github.com/mhintegrity/lesson17

1. Write an app randomName.js, Use fs from this lesson and         JavaScript from Lesson 15 to create console output with a      Random Full Name in it.
*   Create two arrays, one first names and the second last         names. Then randomly put them together in a string and         output to the console.
*   Here is an example of running the app and output:
    > node randomName
    > Fred Flintstone

2. Create a second app namesFile.js.
*   save a list of 10 random names out to a file named             Names.txt

3. Create another app named names.js.
*   accept 2 arguments, fileName and Number
*   output a number of random names to a file with the .txt        extension
*   optionally, if the file name is console, output to the         console instead.
*   example:
    node Names
